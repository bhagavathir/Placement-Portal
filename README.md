# Placement-Portal
DBMS Project

The Placement Portal is an application that allows students to sign up, fill out their resume
and regularly update it, and view the details regarding the opportunities that are available
to them. They will also be able to view the criteria for selection, salary packages, etc., and
filter companies based on the parameters mentioned. Further, this portal will also have a
channel for the companies that come to the campus to hire students, where they can list
their requirements and the descriptions, and view the studentsâ€™ application details. All of
these operations are spearheaded by the Admin who oversees the process and can add
companies and optionally remove students and companies.

The details of the alumni who have gotten placed via this portal are made available to
anyone who visits the application. This will enable visitors to view their details and gain
guidance regarding the same.

The following are the tools that have been utilised to implement this project
1. Front End - HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery
2. Backend - PHP, MySQL
3. Server - XAMPP
